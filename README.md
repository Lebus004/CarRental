## Analysis

**ðŸš§: Reuse and adapt your own analysis and requirements here.**

### Scenario

CarRental_FHNW is a lightweight demonstration system enabling customer and admin to manage a catalog of rental cars, bookings. It provides both administrative and user-facing functionality.

### User Stories

- As an Admin, I want a consistent visual appearance for easy navigation.
- As an Admin, I want to create, edit, delete, car, bookings and access.
- As an Admin, I want to login as a admin for authentication and authorization.
- As an User, I want to create and update or delete my bookings.
- As a User, I want to view available cars and filter by model, type, fuel type.
- As a User, I want to authenticate to access personal data.
- As a User, I want to see the cost of my booking.


### Use Cases

- **UC-1 [Show filtered car list]:**  
  The user can retrieve a list of all available cars in the system, with options to filter by model, type, or fuel type.
- **UC-2 [Show Car Details]:**  
  The user can view detailed information about a specific car, including its model, type, fuel type, seats, and availability.
- **UC-3 [Manage Cars]:**  
  The Admin can create, update, or delete car entries in the catalog.
- **UC-4 [User Authentication]:**  
  The User or Admin can log in to access personalized or administrative features based on their role.
- **UC-5 [Manage Bookings (User)]:**  
  The user can create, update, or delete their own car bookings.
- **UC-6 [Manage Bookings (Admin)]:**  
  The Admin can view, create, update, or delete any bookings for the user in the system.
- **UC-7 [View Booking Cost]:**  
  The user can view the calculated cost of a booking based on the rental duration.



## Design

**ðŸš§: Decide on your CI, color scheme, graphics, layout, and UX. Add wireframes and diagrams as needed.**

### Wireframe

**ðŸš§: List the main pages: Main Screen, Car choices screen, Login, Admin.**

### Prototype

**ðŸš§: create a prototype using placeholder data.**

### Domain Design

**ðŸš§: Provide an entity-relationship diagram.**

Main domain entities may include: Car, Booking, User, VehicleType.

### Business Logic

**Example:**

For booking a car (UC-4):

- **Path:** `/api/bookings`
- **Method:** `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- **Logic:** Users can create, modify, or cancel bookings for available cars. The system checks for overlapping bookings and car availability.

API documentation available at `/swagger-ui.html`.

## Implementation

### Backend Technology

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Java Persistence API (JPA)
- H2 Database (in-memory or persistent)

**Dependencies (excerpt):**

</dependency>
```

**ðŸš§: Describe if you used Spring Initializr or adapted dependencies. Document database setup (in-memory/persistent) and placeholder data initialization.**

### Frontend Technology
